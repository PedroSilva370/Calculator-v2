# Calculator Application (Python + Tkinter)

## Overview

This project is a desktop calculator developed using Python and the Tkinter GUI library.  
It was created as a practical exercise to strengthen understanding of graphical user interface development, event-driven programming, and arithmetic logic implementation.

The application provides a structured interface and reliable handling of user input. Debugging and structural refinements were completed with AI-assisted review to improve organization and code stability.
